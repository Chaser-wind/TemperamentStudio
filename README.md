TemperamentStudio
=================

Temperament Studio - a program that lets you experiment 
with different musical tuning schemes

This repository contains a Java application which allows you
to play notes and chords on an instrument which can be
tuned to different ancient and modern temperaments, and
can change the tuning of a MIDI file.  One possible use is to hear
what a piece of music would sound like on a historical
instrument which used a tuning scheme different from the
standard equal temperament scale widely used today.

The jar file in this repository contains the program as well
as all of the source code for the program.

When the program is run for the first time, it will create
several directories and extract help files as well as
several sample MIDI files.
